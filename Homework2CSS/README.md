# Homework-2-Bootstrap
* extensive project, total time worked about 20 hours

* every page has a functional and consistent navigation bar with stylized color and font

* every page has a functional and consistent sticky footer including my linkedin and github links

* all links open in a new tab

* semantic html used

* all HTML valid and correct

* personalized information entered

* utilizes bootstrap and grids

* index page: photo of myself with text wrapping around

* portfolio page: four thumbnails showing previews of small assignments I've worked on, with working links to the respositories containing their respective code

* contact me page: contains a form with validated fields for name, email, and message box. tutor helped add a basic js function to bring up a separate page (thank_you.html) after the inputs are validated and the submit button is clicked

* all links are functional, all pages are consistent. not too shabby, don't you think?
