        <p>Hello! My name is Celine, I'm a college graduate, and I work part-time at CaptionCall
        providing captioning of phone conversations for those who are deaf or hard-of-hearding.
        I also volunteer with the San Antonio Feral Cat Coalition. I have one long-haired, black
        cat named Merlin. My friend took in a stray pregnant cat about 10 years ago, and he was
        one of her kittens, so I've had him since he was born!</p>

        <p>I'm looking forward to becoming a web developer at the end of this program and having
        a different direction in my life. My partner is also taking an accelerated web development
        course, and we plan to move in together once we both complete our schooling and have 
        steady jobs.</p>
