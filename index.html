                    Hello, my name is Celine Ross, I currently live in San Antonio but plan to move to Austin in the
                    near future. I'm 23 years old with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology with
                    a minor
                    in Wellness. I'm an only child, and I have one black cat named Merlin. I decided to enter
                    the field
                    of web development because my college degree, unsurprisingly, was pretty useless without
                    further
                    training. I started graduate school to become a Licensed Professional Counselor, but decided
                    after
                    about two months it wasn't the field for me and dropped out. I was working at Staples at the
                    time
                    in the print center, and decided to stay there full-time to pay my bills. After a while I
                    became aware
                    of the bootcamp programs at UTSA, my alma matre. I chose the web development program and I'm
                    now
                    enjoying it thoroughly. I look forward to the skills I'm going to develop, and being able to
                    market
                    my skills to future employers with the help of career services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of my hobbies include reading, writing, and now... coding! I've actually been playing
                    with the
                    idea of writing and publishing a book to Amazon to make some extra money and fulfill a
                    lifelong dream
                    of writing my own novel. I've been bouncing around ideas of possibly a young-adult novel, a
                    fantasy
                    series, or even a nonfiction book about the history of rock 'n roll. In addition to writing,
                    I play
                    drums recreationally. I aspire to join a band and perform once my skills are adequate enough
                    to draw
                    an audience. I'd wanted to play drums since I was really little, so as soon as I was able to
                    afford
                    a drum kit and some lessons, I dove right in. I bought my first real drum kit (I had to use
                    an electronic
                    kit when I lived in an apartment complex for noise reasons) about a year ago, and it is by
                    far my most
                    prized possession. I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about me!
